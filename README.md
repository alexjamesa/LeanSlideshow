# LeanSlideshow
*Slides are fully responsive with text and scaleable images. Slideshow is button and timer controlled. (HTML/CSS/JS)*

Website visitors are using devices of every possible screen size, and so a good website must be responsive. That includes all the page's widgets and tools too! With that in mind, here's some code for a common website element: the slideshow. 
* Each slide comprises scaleable images and text
* The slideshow slides along to a timer or button press
* The content is spread across two columns for wider screens and combines into one column for narrow screens
* Clear variable names and comments make it easily stylable and customizable

Feedback and suggestions welcom. Enjoy!
