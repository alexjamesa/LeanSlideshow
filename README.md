# LeanSlideshow
*Slides are fully responsive with text and scaleable images. Slideshow is button and timer controlled. (HTML/CSS/JS)*

Website visitors are using devices of every possible screen size, and so a good website must be responsive. That includes all the page's widgets and tools too! With that in mind, here's some code for a common website element: the slideshow. 
* Each slide comprises text and a scaleable image
* The slideshow slides along to a timer or button press
* The content is spread across two columns for wider screens and combines into one column for narrow screens
* Clear variable names and comments make it easily stylable and customizable

Some common customizations will be to add new slides and new images. 
* To add a slide, simply copy and paste an old slide in the HTML file (everything between a set of "li" tags), leaving no whitespace between the new slide and the previous slide. Then go into the CSS file and edit the lines marked "WHEN CHANGING SLIDES" as noted.
* When changing the image, change the image path in the CSS file and then any lines marked "WHEN CHANGING IMAGE" as well.

Feedback and suggestions welcome. Enjoy!
